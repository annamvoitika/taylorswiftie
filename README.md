# Taylor Swiftie 

... will get us through the lockdown 3.0

*How can anyone possibly choose just one Taylor Swift's song to start the day with??*

This is what I was asking myself every morning, as I warmed up before morning standups and franctically scrolled through Taylor's entire music collection.

As my family refused to send me daily Taylor Swift song choices I had to make someone or something else...

## Pick a song for me!

Here comes the simplest script you can run in your Terminal whenever you need a T Swift song to lift your spirits.

## Instructions

Clone the repo and run ./swiftie.sh in your terminal.

Ta da!
