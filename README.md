# Taylor Swiftie 

... will get us through the lockdown 3.0

*How can anyone possibly choose just one Taylor Swift's song to start the day with??*

This is what I was asking myself every morning, as I warmed up before morning standups and frantically scrolled through Taylor's entire music collection.

As my family refused to send me daily Taylor Swift song choices I had to make someone or something else...

## Pick a song for me!

Here comes the simplest script you can run in your Terminal whenever you need a T Swift song to lift your spirits.

## Instructions

If you don't have figlet installed -> brew install figlet.

Clone the repo and run ./swiftie.sh in your terminal.

### Scraper logic

You can find scraper logic in getsongs.py. You don't need to do anything with it as I've already extracted all original song titles which can be found in table.csv file. However, if you wish to reuse any parts, feel free to take a look.
